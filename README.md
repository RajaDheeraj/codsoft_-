## Facial Detection and Recognition
This project implements a system to detect and recognize faces using computer vision techniques. It involves:
- **Face Detection:** Identifying faces within images or video streams.
- **Face Recognition:** Matching detected faces with known identities.

### Key Features:
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV.
- Recognition using a pre-trained model.

---

## Recommendation System
This project focuses on building a recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences or past interactions.

### Key Features:
- User and item-based collaborative filtering.
- Content-based recommendation engine.
- Suitable for e-commerce or media platforms.

## Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
This project demonstrates a simple chatbot that provides responses based on predefined rules.

### Key Features:
- Rule-based conversational logic.
- Keyword matching for response generation.
- Suitable for FAQs and basic support systems.

## Setup and Usage
### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `nltk`, `opencv-python`
